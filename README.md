## Problem Statement

Hackathon : <https://devfolio.co/google-genaiexchange/challenges>

Revolutionize Insurance Accessibility and Trust with AI. Develop an AI-powered humanoid agent that transforms the insurance experience for consumers.

The platform should:

* Simplify: Provide 24/7, personalized guidance on policy selection and claims via voice, video, or chat.
* Educate: Ensure clear understanding of policy terms and accurate disclosures, fostering trust.
* Streamline: Automate form-filling with AI for error-free applications and higher claim acceptance rates.
* Focus Area (Subset): Prioritize building an AI-powered form-filling assistant for immediate impact.

The ideal solution will be user-friendly, promote financial literacy, and significantly enhance insurance penetration and consumer satisfaction. Let's use technology to make insurance work for everyone!

### Getting Started

Pre-requisties

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

There's an additional step to setup up environment variables for the backend application mentioned in the [README.md](./backend/README.md) file.

## Accessing the application

The frontend application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

The backend application will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
