# React Frontend

Here, we create a React application that can upload a document and chat with the agent.

## Running the application

To run the application, we use Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
cd ..
docker-compose up --build
```

## Accessing the application

The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

> Note: The backend application must be running for the frontend application to work.
